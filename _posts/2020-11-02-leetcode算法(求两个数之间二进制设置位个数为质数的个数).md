### 题目 
 [https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/)

 - 难度
 *简单*
 - 说明
*Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.*

*(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)*

 - 示例

``` bash
Input: L = 6, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
 ```

``` bash
Input: L = 10, R = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
 ```
### 解题

``` js
/**
 * @param {number} L
 * @param {number} R
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPrimeSetBits = function(L, R) {
    let num=0
    for(let i=L;i<=R;i++){
        let count=0;
        let m=i;
        while(m>1){
           if(m%2==1){
              count++
            } 
           m=Math.floor(m/2); 
        }
        if(m==1){
           count++
        };
        if(isPrime(count)){
            num++; 
        }
    }
    
   function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 3) {
        return num > 1;
    }
    // 不在6的倍数两侧的一定不是质数
    if (num % 6 != 1 && num % 6 != 5) {
        return false;
    }
    let sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);
    for (let i = 5; i <= sqrt; i += 6) {
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
   }
    return num;
};
```
